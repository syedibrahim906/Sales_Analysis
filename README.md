Regional Sales Analysis Project 

‚ùì Problem Statement

A retail company operates across multiple regions and wants to understand how its products are performing across different cities, states, and sales channels. The company has collected detailed sales data, including product names, order quantities, revenue, costs, and customer location. However, due to the volume and complexity of the data, it is difficult to derive actionable insights without proper analysis.

üéØ Objective

The goal of this project is to perform a comprehensive sales analysis using Python. This includes:

Identifying top-performing products and cities by revenue.

Analyzing sales trends over time.

Evaluating revenue contribution across various sales channels.

Calculating profit, total cost, and profit margin.

Visualizing insights using charts like bar plots, line charts  etc.

üìÅ Dataset Overview

File Name: Regional Sales Dataset.xlsx
Structure: Excel workbook with multiple sheets (each sheet = one region)
Each sheet includes:

order_number, order_date, channel

product_name, quantity, unit_price, revenue, cost

city_name, state_name, country, us_region, population

budget, total_cost, profit, profit_margin_pct

üßæ Files and Workflow

1. Regional Sales Dataset.xlsx
Purpose: Raw dataset with region-wise sales information in separate sheets.

Content: Contains customer orders, product info, financial metrics, and geography.

Why It Matters: Consolidation of this data is crucial to building a full business picture.

2. Data Loading & Preprocessing (Jupyter Notebook)
What It Does:

Reads all Excel sheets using pd.read_excel(..., sheet_name=None)

Merges all sheets into one unified DataFrame

Converts column formats (e.g., dates)

Handles missing values and calculates new metrics

Why It‚Äôs Important:

Ensures a clean, consistent dataset ready for analysis

Avoids data leakage and errors in later stages

3. Feature Engineering
   
New Fields Created:

total_cost = quantity * cost

profit = revenue - total_cost

profit_margin_pct = (profit / revenue) * 100

Extracted order_month_name and order_month_numz from dates

Why It‚Äôs Important:

Transforms raw figures into business KPIs

Enables more granular filtering and time-based insights

4. Data Exploration
Insights Extracted:

Top-performing products by revenue

Monthly revenue trends

Channel-wise revenue comparisons (Wholesale, Export, etc.)

Region and city revenue ranking

Profit margin analysis across products and locations

Why It‚Äôs Valuable:

Helps prioritize product focus, marketing efforts, and distribution strategies

5. Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn
Charts Included:

Bar charts (top cities by revenue)

Line charts (monthly revenue trends)

Pie charts (channel share)

Heatmaps
